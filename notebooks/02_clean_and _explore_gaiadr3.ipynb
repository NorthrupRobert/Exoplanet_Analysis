    "2. Approximate classifications of all other stars by utilizing a star's BP-RP color feature, and pairing that with it's absolute magnitude (**This is exactly what many published Gaia DR3 population studies do**)\n",
    "3. Save a star's classification in the gaia_df dataframe, along with the lumonocity class\n",
    "4. Add a confidence flag based on whether the classification is derived from the teff value or not\n",
    "5. Analyze the distribution of star classifications with both known teff values and unkown teff values, and compare those values with a table analyzed using only stars with teff values. The importance of this is twofold: ensuring that approximations of star classifications are accurate AND determining if there are biases in star detection methods\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Pre‑classification Quality Filtering (Added Step)\n",
    "Before classifying any stars, apply Gaia DR3 quality filters to ensure reliable photometry and parallaxes:\n",
    "    - parallax_over_error > 5\n",
    "    - ruwe < 1.4\n",
    "    - phot_bp_rp_excess_factor within recommended range\n",
    "    - Remove stars with non‑positive parallax\n",
    "    - Compute absolute magnitude only for stars passing these filters\n",
    "This produces a clean HR diagram and prevents misclassification due to noisy data.\n",
    "1. For all stars with a known teff value, pair that feature with absolute magnitude to determine their classification.\n",
    "    - This is the most accurate method of classifying stars without spectroscopy\n",
    "    - Use Teff bins to determine spectral type (O/B/A/F/G/K/M).\n",
    "    - Use absolute magnitude to distinguish dwarfs, subgiants, and giants.\n",
    "    - This prevents misclassifying red giants as cool dwarfs.\n",
    "2. Approximate classifications of all other stars by utilizing a star's BP–RP color feature, and pair that with its absolute magnitude to Assign Luminosity Class.\n",
    "    - This is exactly what many published Gaia DR3 population studies do.\n",
    "    - BP–RP alone cannot distinguish dwarfs from giants.\n",
    "    - Absolute magnitude provides the vertical separation needed.\n",
    "    - This step is essential for accurate classification of stars lacking Teff.\n",
    "3. Save a star's classification in the gaia_df dataframe, along with the luminosity class.\n",
    "4. Add a confidence flag based on whether the classification is derived from the Teff value or not.\n",
    "    - High confidence → Teff‑based\n",
    "    - Medium confidence → BP–RP + good parallax\n",
    "    - Low confidence → BP–RP + borderline parallax quality\n",
    "5. Add a classification_source Column (Added Step). This will make downstream filtering and analysis easier. Here are some examples:\n",
    "    - \"teff\"\n",
    "    - \"color\"\n",
    "    - \"color_low_quality\"\n",

    "    2. determining if there are biases in star detection methods\n",

    "    - Classify them using Teff\n",
    "    - Classify them again using BP–RP\n",
    "    - Compare results (confusion matrix, misclassification rate)\n",

    "    - Teff‑classified stars\n",
    "    - BP–RP‑classified stars\n",
    "    - Dwarfs vs giants\n",
