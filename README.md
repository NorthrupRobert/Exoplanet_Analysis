#EXO-PLANET ANALYSIS
Challenging means of exoplanet identification.

##QUESTION
This project serves as an analysis of current methods being utilize to identify exoplanets within the visible universe

1. Detection Bias & Star Type

    Question: Are we disproportionately finding planets around certain types of stars (e.g., red dwarfs) because of telescope sensitivity?

    Why it stands out: Highlights how our tools shape what we “see” and what we might be missing.

2. Planetary System Architecture

    Question: Do multi-planet systems show consistent spacing patterns (like orbital resonances), or are they chaotic?

    Why it stands out: Connects to theories of planetary migration and system stability.

3. Habitability Beyond Earth-Like Worlds

    Question: Could “super-Earths” or ocean worlds be more common habitable candidates than Earth-sized planets?

    Why it stands out: Challenges the Earth-centric bias in habitability studies

4. The Goldilox Dilema
	Europa (one of the Galilean moons of Jupiter) is a clear example of a breeding ground for life beyond Earth that challenges the notion of the goldilox zone being the only habitable area from which exoplanets can be reasonably identified. This moon challenges that notion, and could alter how we choose to identify exoplanets forever.

	Why it stands out: Challenges our currents means for identifying exoplanets, potentially opening up the door for thousands of more identifyable exoplanets from the data we already have collected.
