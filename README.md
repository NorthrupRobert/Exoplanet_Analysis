## QUESTION
### Overview
This project serves as an analysis of current methods being utilize to identify exoplanets within the visible universe in detection bias & star type:

	Question: Are we disproportionately finding planets around certain types of stars (e.g., red dwarfs) because of telescope sensitivity?

	Why it stands out: Highlights how our tools shape what we “see” and what we might be missing.

### Success Metrics
- *Cleaning:* % Usable Dataset Adjustment
- *Bias:*

### Signifigance
Current exoplanet discoveries are affected heavily by our biases and limitations of our current means of detecting them. Particular types of stars, as a result of this, might appear to host planets much more than they actually do, seeing as these stars are easier to observe. The project here serves as an analysis of detection bias across star types to improve the accuracy of exoplanet occurance estimates and guide future observation expeditions.


### Future Problems to Explore

1. The Goldilocks Dilemna
	Europa (one of the Galilean moons of Jupiter) is a clear example of a breeding ground for life beyond Earth that challenges the notion of the goldilocks zone being the only habitable area from which habitable exoplanets can be reasonably identified. This moon challenges that notion, and could alter how we choose to identify habitable exoplanets and exomoons forever. If we adjusted habitable exoplanet analysis for undersurface seas for interstellar object outside the goldilocks zone?

	Why it stands out: Challenges our currents means for identifying exoplanets, potentially opening up the door for thousands of more identifyable exoplanets from the data we already have collected.

2. Exoplanet Blindspot
	How many exoplanets could we reasonably expect to find should we eliminate our geometric oversights (such as transit identification being dependent on the planet falling within our line of sight) for all star types, not just proxi-suns?

## BACKGROUND
### What makes an Exoplanet?
Exoplanets are defined as planets outside of the Sol System (our solar system). Using our current methods of detection, 6061 exoplanets have been confirmed, based on a strict set of criteria:
According to the NASA Exoplanet Archive and other catalogs, the main criteria are:

    Mass Limit:

        Must be ≤ 30 Jupiter masses.

        Anything larger is considered a brown dwarf (a “failed star”).

    Orbital Requirement:

        Must orbit a star (or stellar remnant).

        Free-floating planets (rogue planets drifting through space) are excluded from most exoplanet catalogs.

    Validation:

        Must have sufficient follow-up observations (e.g., transit confirmation, radial velocity checks).

        False positives (like binary stars mimicking planet signals) must be ruled out.

    Detection Methods:

        Transit (planet passes in front of star).

        Radial velocity (star’s wobble).

        Direct imaging.

        Microlensing.

        Each method has its own reliability thresholds before a candidate is confirmed.

### Methods of Exoplanet Detection
1. Compile data from the following datasets:
    - **Planetary System Composite Data** (NASA Exoplanet Archive) For analyzing detected exoplanets and their host stars
    - **Kepler Stellar** (NASA Exoplanet Archive) Exploring all stellar bodies targeted by the Kepler Space Telescope
    - **Gaia DR3** () Mass Dataset of all known stars in our observable universe.

## THE DATA
NASA's Exoplanet Archive (courtesy of CalTech and NASA) "Planetary Systems" dataset was utilized to exam the features in question. Information was compiled by utilzing the TAP (Table Access Protocol) API, the prime standard as defined by the IVOA (International Virtual Observatory Alliance). TAP is standardized as to not be limited to NASA datasets, but instead utilized cross-organizationally
